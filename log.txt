Subject: Windows Defender Update Failed | Shift Engineer Details Required
 
Hi Team
 
Please log a P3 ticket to windows 10 Fujitsu resolver group for the below issue.
 
We are from BAT MSSP EPP service (SCCM) team and we could see that some of the machines in BAT are not properly getting the update from the Windows Defender either manually or by automatic deployment. This issue is a critical impact to the BAT security environment. We had a troubleshooting session with the Microsoft team and SCCM Fujitsu team today and the call was scheduled to be continued tomorrow during the time 12:00 PM IST.
 
We would require an engineer from the Windows 10 Fujitsu team to join the call and troubleshooting with us. Hence, please request the team to provide the availability of a shift engineer and share the contact details with us. The call duration is not yet confirmed. It may be from 12:00 PM IST - 9:00 PM IST as per the availability of end user, MS team and Fujitsu team. So, extended support would be required.
 
Please let us know if you require any clarifications.
 
Kindly raise the ticket with a high priority and revert back us the ticket number.

<tr><td>2017-04-12 11:39:12</td><td>CH620828</td><td>4</td><td>Hi Team,
 
We are part of BAT-MSSP EPS team. We found that around 1014 machines in Brazil have not taken Windows Defender signature update for more than 7 days. We have attached a report with the details of machines which has not taken the update. 
 
Please assign the ticket to Local EM(Brazil) and advice them to take necessary actions on the machines(Try to Manually update).
 
Attached the SOP to perform manual signature update. Please refer to it.
 
Kindly consider this task on very high priority and provide us an update. Also please provide us the reason for this large number of machines being non-compliant.

Subject: Windows Defender Update Failed | Shift Engineer Details Required
 
Hi Team
 
Please log a P3 ticket to windows 10 Fujitsu resolver group for the below issue.
 
We are from BAT MSSP EPP service (SCCM) team and we could see that some of the machines in BAT are not properly getting the update from the Windows Defender either manually or by automatic deployment. This issue is a critical impact to the BAT security environment. We had a troubleshooting session with the Microsoft team and SCCM Fujitsu team today and the call was scheduled to be continued tomorrow during the time 12:00 PM IST.
 
We would require an engineer from the Windows 10 Fujitsu team to join the call and troubleshooting with us. Hence, please request the team to provide the availability of a shift engineer and share the contact details with us. The call duration is not yet confirmed. It may be from 12:00 PM IST - 9:00 PM IST as per the availability of end user, MS team and Fujitsu team. So, extended support would be required.
 
Please let us know if you require any clarifications.
 
Kindly raise the ticket with a high priority and revert back us the ticket number.

We are part of BAT-MSSP EPS team. We found that around 1014 machines in Brazil have not taken Windows Defender signature update for more than 7 days. We have attached a report with the details of machines which has not taken the update. 
 
Please assign the ticket to Local EM(Brazil) and advice them to take necessary actions on the machines(Try to Manually update).
 
Attached the SOP to perform manual signature update. Please refer to it.

Subject: Windows Defender Update Failed | Shift Engineer Details Required
 
Hi Team
 
Please log a P3 ticket to windows 10 Fujitsu resolver group for the below issue.
 
We are from BAT MSSP EPP service (SCCM) team and we could see that some of the machines in BAT are not properly getting the update from the Windows Defender either manually or by automatic deployment. This issue is a critical impact to the BAT security environment. We had a troubleshooting session with the Microsoft team and SCCM Fujitsu team today and the call was scheduled to be continued tomorrow during the time 12:00 PM IST.
 
We would require an engineer from the Windows 10 Fujitsu team to join the call and troubleshooting with us. Hence, please request the team to provide the availability of a shift engineer and share the contact details with us. The call duration is not yet confirmed. It may be from 12:00 PM IST - 9:00 PM IST as per the availability of end user, MS team and Fujitsu team. So, extended support would be required.
 
Please let us know if you require any clarifications.
 
Kindly raise the ticket with a high priority and revert back us the ticket number.

We are part of BAT-MSSP EPS team. We found that around 1014 machines in Brazil have not taken Windows Defender signature update for more than 7 days. We have attached a report with the details of machines which has not taken the update. 
 
Please assign the ticket to Local EM(Brazil) and advice them to take necessary actions on the machines(Try to Manually update).
 
Attached the SOP to perform manual signature update. Please refer to it.
 
Kindly consider this task on very high priority and provide us an update. Also please provide us the reason for this large number of machines being non-compliant.

Subject: Windows Defender Update Failed | Shift Engineer Details Required
 
Hi Team
 
Please log a P3 ticket to windows 10 Fujitsu resolver group for the below issue.
 
We are from BAT MSSP EPP service (SCCM) team and we could see that some of the machines in BAT are not properly getting the update from the Windows Defender either manually or by automatic deployment. This issue is a critical impact to the BAT security environment. We had a troubleshooting session with the Microsoft team and SCCM Fujitsu team today and the call was scheduled to be continued tomorrow during the time 12:00 PM IST.
 
We would require an engineer from the Windows 10 Fujitsu team to join the call and troubleshooting with us. Hence, please request the team to provide the availability of a shift engineer and share the contact details with us. The call duration is not yet confirmed. It may be from 12:00 PM IST - 9:00 PM IST as per the availability of end user, MS team and Fujitsu team. So, extended support would be required.
 
Please let us know if you require any clarifications.
 
Kindly raise the ticket with a high priority and revert back us the ticket number.

We are part of BAT-MSSP EPS team. We found that around 1014 machines in Brazil have not taken Windows Defender signature update for more than 7 days. We have attached a report with the details of machines which has not taken the update. 
 
Please assign the ticket to Local EM(Brazil) and advice them to take necessary actions on the machines(Try to Manually update).
 
Attached the SOP to perform manual signature update. Please refer to it.
 
Kindly consider this task on very high priority and provide us an update. Also please provide us the reason for this large number of machines being non-compliant.
